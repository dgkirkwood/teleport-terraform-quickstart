# Teleport Auto-Upgrade Endpoint

This code will create an endpoint for Teleport auto-upgrades, as described [here](https://goteleport.com/docs/management/operations/self-hosted-automatic-agent-updates/?scope=enterprise).

The endpoint is hosted on AWS S3, via CloudFront for TLS with an ACM certificate.
